## Customer-Segmentation-Python

### Situation:
The project focuses on analyzing a "Superstore" dataset to gain insights into customer segmentation, sales performance, customer loyalty, shipping strategies, and product popularity.

### Task:
The goal was to perform exploratory data analysis to identify key customer segments, understand sales distribution across different categories, evaluate customer loyalty, analyze shipping modes, and determine the most popular products.

### Action:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset. Checked for null values and duplicates to ensure data quality.

Customer Segmentation: Identified the types of customers and their distribution. Visualized the segmentation with pie charts.

Sales Analysis: Calculated total sales for each customer segment and visualized the data using bar charts.

Customer Loyalty: Analyzed customer order frequency to identify repeat customers and top spenders.

Shipping Strategies: Evaluated the usage frequency of different shipping modes and visualized the distribution with pie charts.

Sales by State and City: Analyzed sales distribution across different states and cities.

Product Analysis: Identified popular product categories and sub-categories, and calculated their sales.

### Results:

Customer Segmentation: The largest segment is 'Consumer' (51.9%), followed by 'Corporate' (30.2%) and 'Home Office' (17.8%).

Sales Analysis: The 'Consumer' segment had the highest total sales followed by 'Corporate' and 'Home Office'.

Customer Loyalty: William Brown was identified as the most frequent customer with 37 orders. Sean Miller was the top spender with sales of $25,043.05.

Shipping Strategies: 'Standard Class' was the most used shipping mode (59.7%), followed by 'Second Class', 'First Class', and 'Same Day'.

Sales by State and City: California had the highest number of customers and sales. New York City was the top city in terms of sales.

Product Analysis: 'Technology' category had the highest sales, followed by 'Furniture' and 'Office Supplies'. 'Phones' (Technology) was the top sub-category in sales.

### Reflection:

This analysis provides valuable insights for targeting customer segments, optimizing shipping strategies, and focusing on high-performing product categories to maximize sales. Further analysis could involve predictive modeling to forecast future sales and customer behavior.
